# MSXlib

MSXlib is composed of several groups of libraries (ASM files): MSX-related core, MSX-related optionals, games core, genre-specific (such as platformers), and generic game optionals. This libraries can be used incrementally, but designed to work together.

The [Getting started with MSXlib](doc/guide.md) guide will help you start using MSXlib using a serie of examples.
